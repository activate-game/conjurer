# Conjurer

Conjurer is a game content creation tool built with [React](https://github.com/facebook/react). It communicates with [Blackguard](https://github.com/activate-game/blackguard) via [Conjurer](https://github.com/activate-game/conjurer) to allow multiple players to collaborate on a single game session.

This project was built for my [Activate](http://www.activateconf.com/) 2019 workshop, _Let’s Go On an Adventure: Building a Realtime, Collaborative Game with Web Tech_. One of the central ideas behind that workshop was that this project—and its related projects—should serve as but an MVP for a game, so PRs are welcome!
